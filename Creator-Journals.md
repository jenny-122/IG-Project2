1. Why my Player wouldn't fall when going off the map:
    - Turn off "is Kinamatic" 
2. When creating a Player
    - Don't forget the Ridgid body components
    - Add the PlayerController Script by dragging it onto the GameComponent
3. Camera Controller
    - I remember that you don't add the main camera onto the Player
    - Instead you add the CameraController script to the main camera
    - There is an initalized GameComponent variabel in the script we wrote, so you need to drag and drop the PlayerComponent to that box in the Unity Editor 
    - You also need to rotate the camera down in the Unity Editor (recommended 30-45 degrees) to see the player
